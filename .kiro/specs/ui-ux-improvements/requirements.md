# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for comprehensive UI/UX improvements to the FHIR resource visualizer application. The improvements focus on creating a more polished, accessible, and user-friendly experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Key areas include responsive layout optimization, modal system redesign, multi-patient workflow enhancements, internationalization support, and dark mode implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Responsive Layout and Scrolling

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the application to utilize the full viewport without unnecessary borders and provide smooth scrolling experiences, so that I can maximize my screen real estate and navigate content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on desktop or tablet THEN the system SHALL display the application at exactly the size of the viewport without any colored borders around the application
2. WHEN content exceeds the available vertical space THEN the system SHALL provide vertical scrolling with a custom-styled scrollbar that matches the application design
3. WHEN the application loads on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL extend to full width and allow vertical scrolling to access all content
4. WHEN scrolling occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance and visual consistency across all device types
5. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively without breaking the full-viewport design

### Requirement 2: Modal System Redesign

**User Story:** As a user interacting with modals, I want stable, predictable modal experiences without layout shifts or nested overlays, so that I can navigate through modal content efficiently and intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a modal opens THEN the system SHALL display it with a fixed, stable size that does not change based on content
2. WHEN modal content changes THEN the system SHALL NOT cause layout shifts or size adjustments to the modal container
3. WHEN additional modal-like content is needed THEN the system SHALL implement page-based navigation within the modal instead of opening nested modals
4. WHEN navigating between modal pages THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation controls to return to previous pages
5. WHEN a modal contains multiple pages THEN the system SHALL maintain the same modal dimensions across all pages

### Requirement 3: Multi-Patient Tab Management

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to search for and view multiple patients simultaneously in tabs, so that I can efficiently compare patient data and manage multiple cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the patient management interface THEN the system SHALL display a "Search Patient" button alongside the existing "Add Patient" button
2. WHEN clicking the "Search Patient" button THEN the system SHALL provide a search interface to find existing patients
3. WHEN selecting a patient from search results THEN the system SHALL open that patient's data in a new tab
4. WHEN multiple patients are open THEN the system SHALL display them in clearly labeled tabs with patient identifiers
5. WHEN switching between patient tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain the state and scroll position of each patient's view
6. WHEN closing a patient tab THEN the system SHALL remove only that patient's data while preserving other open tabs

### Requirement 4: Internationalization Support

**User Story:** As a user who speaks different languages, I want to switch the application language dynamically, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL detect the user's browser language preference as the default language
2. WHEN accessing language settings THEN the system SHALL provide a language selector with available language options
3. WHEN selecting a different language THEN the system SHALL immediately update all UI text, labels, and messages without requiring a page refresh
4. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's language preference for future sessions
5. WHEN displaying dates, numbers, or other locale-specific content THEN the system SHALL format them according to the selected language's conventions
6. WHEN new text content is added to the application THEN the system SHALL support easy addition of translations through a structured internationalization system

### Requirement 5: Dark Mode Implementation

**User Story:** As a user with visual preferences or working in different lighting conditions, I want to toggle between light and dark themes, so that I can customize the visual appearance for optimal comfort and usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL detect the user's system theme preference (light/dark) as the default
2. WHEN accessing theme settings THEN the system SHALL provide a theme toggle control (light/dark mode)
3. WHEN light mode is active THEN the system SHALL use the color palette: #DDF4E7, #67C090, #26667F, #124170
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL use the color palette: #210F37, #4F1C51, #A55B4B, #DCA06D
5. WHEN switching themes THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new color scheme to all UI elements without page refresh
6. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios and accessibility standards for all text and interactive elements
7. WHEN the user's theme preference is set THEN the system SHALL persist this choice for future sessions
8. WHEN custom scrollbars are displayed THEN the system SHALL style them appropriately for both light and dark themes
