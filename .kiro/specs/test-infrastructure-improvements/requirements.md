# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on fixing and improving the test infrastructure for the FHIR Health UI application. The current test suite has multiple failures due to missing context providers, incomplete mock implementations, element selection issues, and timeout problems. This improvement will establish a robust testing foundation that ensures reliable test execution and better development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to have proper context providers, so that components can render correctly during testing without context-related failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test runs THEN the system SHALL provide all necessary React context providers (PatientProvider, NotificationProvider, OrganizationProvider, AuthProvider)
2. WHEN a component requires context THEN the test wrapper SHALL automatically include the required providers
3. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL NOT fail due to missing context provider errors
4. WHEN a new context provider is added THEN the test wrapper SHALL be easily extensible to include it

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete FHIR client mock implementations, so that tests can simulate all necessary API interactions without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need to simulate FHIR operations THEN the mock client SHALL provide all required methods (createResource, getPatientEncounters, etc.)
2. WHEN a test calls a FHIR client method THEN the mock SHALL return realistic test data
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL NOT fail due to missing mock method implementations
4. WHEN new FHIR operations are added THEN the mock client SHALL be easily extensible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable element selection in tests, so that tests can consistently find and interact with UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests need to select elements THEN the system SHALL use specific selectors (by role, test-id, aria-label)
2. WHEN multiple elements have the same text THEN tests SHALL use more specific selection strategies
3. WHEN elements are selected THEN tests SHALL handle cases where multiple matches exist
4. WHEN UI changes occur THEN element selection SHALL remain stable through specific identifiers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to handle asynchronous operations properly, so that tests don't fail due to timing issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests involve network simulation THEN the system SHALL provide adequate timeouts
2. WHEN async operations occur THEN tests SHALL wait appropriately for completion
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL optimize async operations to prevent unnecessary delays
4. WHEN timeouts are needed THEN they SHALL be configurable and reasonable for the operation type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive test utility framework, so that writing and maintaining tests is efficient and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new tests THEN developers SHALL have access to reusable test utilities
2. WHEN tests need common setup THEN the framework SHALL provide standardized helper functions
3. WHEN PowerShell execution policy restrictions exist THEN the system SHALL work around script execution limitations
4. WHEN using Vite for testing THEN all utilities SHALL be compatible with the Vite test environment
