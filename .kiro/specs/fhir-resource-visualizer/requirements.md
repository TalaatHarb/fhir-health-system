# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FHIR Resource Visualizer is a comprehensive web application that enables healthcare professionals to visualize and interact with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data. The application provides an intuitive interface for managing patient information, viewing encounter timelines, and creating/viewing various healthcare resources such as observations, conditions, medication requests, diagnostic reports, and procedures. The system integrates with existing FHIR server implementations to provide real-time access to healthcare data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to authenticate into the system with a fake login page, so that I can access the FHIR resource visualization tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a fake login page
2. WHEN I enter any credentials on the login page THEN the system SHALL set a global authentication state to "logged in"
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the organization selection modal
4. IF no credentials are entered THEN the system SHALL still allow login for development purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to select an organization to work with, so that I can access organization-specific patient data and resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I successfully log in THEN the system SHALL display a modal with a list of available organizations
2. WHEN I select an organization from the list THEN the system SHALL set the current organization in global state
3. WHEN I select an organization THEN the system SHALL close the modal and display the main patient search interface
4. WHEN I am in the main application THEN the system SHALL provide a way to reopen the organization selection modal
5. WHEN I switch organizations THEN the system SHALL update the global state and refresh relevant data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to search for patients and manage patient records, so that I can access and organize patient information efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the main interface THEN the system SHALL display a patient search bar
2. WHEN I enter search criteria THEN the system SHALL query the FHIR server for matching patients
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display a list of matching patients with key identifying information
4. WHEN I select a patient from search results THEN the system SHALL open the patient's main page in a new tab
5. WHEN I want to create a new patient THEN the system SHALL provide a "Create New Patient" button
6. WHEN I click "Create New Patient" THEN the system SHALL open a patient creation form

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to work with multiple patients simultaneously in different tabs, so that I can efficiently compare and manage multiple patient cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a patient THEN the system SHALL open the patient page in a new tab
2. WHEN I have multiple patient tabs open THEN the system SHALL maintain separate state for each patient
3. WHEN I switch between patient tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve the current state of each tab
4. WHEN I close a patient tab THEN the system SHALL clean up the associated state
5. WHEN I have no patient tabs open THEN the system SHALL display the main search interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to view a patient's encounter timeline, so that I can understand the chronological history of the patient's healthcare interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open a patient's main page THEN the system SHALL display a timeline of the patient's encounters
2. WHEN encounters are displayed THEN the system SHALL show them in chronological order with most recent first
3. WHEN I view an encounter in the timeline THEN the system SHALL display key information such as date, type, and status
4. WHEN I click on an encounter THEN the system SHALL expand to show detailed encounter information
5. WHEN no encounters exist for a patient THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to view detailed information about previous encounters, so that I can review all interactions and resources associated with specific healthcare visits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select an encounter from the timeline THEN the system SHALL display detailed encounter information
2. WHEN viewing encounter details THEN the system SHALL show all associated resources (Observations, Conditions, MedicationRequests, DiagnosticReports, Procedures)
3. WHEN I view associated resources THEN the system SHALL provide visual representations appropriate for each resource type
4. WHEN I click on a specific resource THEN the system SHALL display detailed resource information
5. WHEN viewing resource details THEN the system SHALL format the information in a user-friendly, clinical-relevant manner

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to create new encounters with associated resources, so that I can document new patient interactions and clinical findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on a patient's main page THEN the system SHALL provide a "Create New Encounter" button
2. WHEN I click "Create New Encounter" THEN the system SHALL open an encounter creation form
3. WHEN creating an encounter THEN the system SHALL allow me to add Observations, Conditions, MedicationRequests, DiagnosticReports, and Procedures
4. WHEN I add resources to an encounter THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate forms for each resource type
5. WHEN I save a new encounter THEN the system SHALL submit the data to the FHIR server and update the patient timeline

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want to see visually appealing and informative representations of FHIR resources, so that I can quickly understand and interpret clinical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any FHIR resource THEN the system SHALL display it with appropriate visual formatting
2. WHEN viewing Observations THEN the system SHALL show values, units, reference ranges, and trends where applicable
3. WHEN viewing Conditions THEN the system SHALL display severity, status, and clinical significance clearly
4. WHEN viewing MedicationRequests THEN the system SHALL show dosage, frequency, and administration instructions prominently
5. WHEN viewing DiagnosticReports THEN the system SHALL present results in a structured, easy-to-read format
6. WHEN viewing Procedures THEN the system SHALL display procedure details, outcomes, and associated notes
7. WHEN applicable THEN the system SHALL use charts, graphs, or other visual elements to enhance data comprehension

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a healthcare professional, I want the application to communicate directly with existing FHIR servers, so that I can access real-time, up-to-date patient information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application needs patient data THEN the system SHALL make API calls to the configured FHIR server
2. WHEN creating or updating resources THEN the system SHALL send appropriate FHIR-compliant requests to the server
3. WHEN server communication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
4. WHEN data is retrieved from the server THEN the system SHALL validate FHIR resource compliance
5. WHEN working offline or with server issues THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation of functionality
