```

## Usage

### Authentication
1. Navigate to the application
2. Use the "Demo Login" button for development, or enter any credentials
3. The system uses fake authentication for development purposes

### Organization Selection
1. After login, select an organization from the available options
2. Switch organizations using the "Switch Org" button in the header
3. Each organization can have its own FHIR server configuration

### Patient Management
1. Use the search bar to find patients by name, ID, or other identifiers
2. Click on a patient to open them in a new tab
3. Manage multiple patients simultaneously using the tab system
4. Create new patients using the "New Patient" button

### Viewing Patient Data
1. Patient encounters are displayed in a chronological timeline
2. Click on encounters to view associated resources
3. Resources are displayed with clinical-friendly formatting
4. Use the expandable sections to view detailed information

### Creating New Data
1. Use the "New Encounter" button to create encounters
2. Add various resources (observations, conditions, etc.) to encounters
3. Forms include validation and FHIR compliance checking
4. Success/error feedback is provided for all operations

```

### State Management
The application uses React Context API for state management:
- **AuthContext**: User authentication and session management
- **OrganizationContext**: Organization selection and switching
- **PatientContext**: Multi-patient tab management
- **NotificationContext**: Toast notifications and user feedback

### FHIR Integration
- Modular FHIR client with support for multiple servers
- Resource-specific services for different FHIR resource types
- Error handling and retry mechanisms for network operations
- Offline queue for operations when disconnected

## Testing

The application includes comprehensive testing:

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and function testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow testing

### Test Coverage
- Authentication flows
- Organization management
- Patient search and management
- Encounter and resource visualization
- Error handling scenarios
- Accessibility features
- Performance optimizations

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- PatientSearch.test.tsx

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Accessibility

The application is built with accessibility as a first-class concern:

### Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with logical tab order
- **Screen Reader Support**: Comprehensive ARIA labels and live regions
- **High Contrast**: Support for high contrast display modes
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's motion preferences
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling in modals and dynamic content
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations

### Testing Accessibility
- Use screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to test functionality
- Navigate using only the keyboard
- Test with high contrast mode enabled
- Verify with accessibility testing tools

## Performance

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of route components
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking and dead code elimination
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- **Debouncing**: Search inputs and API calls
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large patient and encounter lists
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading and responsive images

### Performance Monitoring
- Use browser DevTools to monitor performance
- Check bundle size with `npm run build`
- Monitor memory usage during development
- Test on various devices and network conditions
