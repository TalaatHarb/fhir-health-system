# Project Foundation Setup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- ✅ React Router DOM (v7.8.2) for routing
- ✅ Vitest (v3.2.4) for testing
- ✅ React Testing Library (v16.3.0) for component testing
- ✅ Jest DOM (v6.8.0) for DOM testing utilities
- ✅ User Event (v14.6.1) for user interaction testing
- ✅ JSDOM (v26.1.0) for DOM environment in tests

### 2. TypeScript Interfaces Created
- ✅ **FHIR Resource Types** (`src/types/fhir.ts`)
  - Complete FHIR R4 interfaces for Patient, Organization, Encounter, Observation, Condition, MedicationRequest, DiagnosticReport, Procedure
  - Supporting data types (Coding, CodeableConcept, Reference, etc.)
  - Bundle and search query interfaces
  - Union types for resource handling

- ✅ **Application State Types** (`src/types/app.ts`)
  - Authentication state and context interfaces
  - Organization management interfaces
  - Patient management and multi-tab interfaces
  - UI state and notification interfaces
  - Form handling and validation interfaces
  - API response and error interfaces

### 3. Directory Structure Created

└── __tests__/        # Test files and setup
```

### 4. ESLint Configuration Enhanced
- ✅ **Healthcare-specific rules** added for data safety
- ✅ **Strict null checks** enforced for healthcare data integrity
- ✅ **Explicit function return types** for critical functions
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** rules
- ✅ **Naming conventions** for healthcare applications
- ✅ **Security rules** for healthcare data protection
- ✅ **Test-specific rule overrides** for testing flexibility

### 5. Testing Setup Configured
- ✅ **Vitest configuration** with JSDOM environment
- ✅ **Test setup file** with mocked browser APIs
- ✅ **Coverage reporting** configured
- ✅ **Test scripts** added to package.json
- ✅ **Sample tests** created and passing (8/8 tests pass)

### 6. Additional Files Created
- ✅ **Constants file** with healthcare-specific constants
- ✅ **Index files** for organized exports
- ✅ **Vitest configuration** for testing
- ✅ **Test setup** with proper mocking

## Key Features Implemented

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive FHIR R4 resource interfaces
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Healthcare data validation types
- Union types for flexible resource handling

### Code Quality
- ESLint rules tailored for healthcare applications
- Enforced null safety for patient data
- Consistent naming conventions
- Security-focused linting rules

### Testing Foundation
- Complete testing environment setup
- DOM testing utilities configured
- Coverage reporting enabled
- Sample tests demonstrating functionality

### Project Organization
- Logical directory structure for scalability
- Separation of concerns (components, services, contexts)
- Centralized type definitions
- Utility functions and constants

## Next Steps
The project foundation is now ready for implementing the remaining tasks:
- Task 2: FHIR client service layer
- Task 3: Authentication system
- Task 4: Organization selection
- And subsequent feature implementations

## Verification
- ✅ All tests passing (8/8)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint warnings minimal and acceptable
- ✅ Project structure follows healthcare application best practices
